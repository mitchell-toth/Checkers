# Python Checkers
Checkers with automatic and manual playing

# Players
Player 1 is at the top of the board, while Player 2 is at the bottom. There are different player options, including:
 - Px_manual	= 	Manual move selection
 - Px_dumb		= 	Random move selection
 - Px_smart		=	Intelligent move selection according to 27 heuristics
 
Where Px is either "P1" or "P2". 

To change the player type, rename the desired file to be Px (either "P1" or "P2").
The main program looks for files named P1 and P2.

# Tests
Heuristics test files are provided to demo Px_smart features.

Within "main.py", edit the call to "checkersMain()" toward the bottom of the file.

# Run
Run "main.py"
